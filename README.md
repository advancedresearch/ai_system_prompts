# AI System Prompts
A library of AI system prompts for Large Language Models

This library is designed for Large Language Models with the overall goal of [Building a Galactic Civilization](https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/papers-wip2/build-a-galactic-civilization.pdf).

The idea is that, although building a galactic civilization is a long term goal for humanity,
it captures many higher order human values as sub-goals.
Therefore, by working toward the overall goal, the hope is that useful things will be discovered on the way.

An idea is to improve efficiency toward this goal by researching existing AI Assistant technologies.
By keeping an up-to-date repository of system prompts for various AI assistants,
researchers can easier compare results and suggest improvements.
